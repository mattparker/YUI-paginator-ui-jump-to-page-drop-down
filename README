YUI Paginator ui template
=========================

YUI paginator wiget http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/paginator/ supports 
custom templates.  This is one.

It provides a <select> html element listing all pages.  Selecting one
of these will change the page.  This is useful if you've got a lot
more pages than you are displaying page links.  Say you've got 200 pages
and 10 page links along the top, you have to keep clicking next to get to 
page 100.  With this you just select 100 from the drop down.

To add to a template, you'll need to include this, after you've included
YUI paginator and other things, but before you render your paginator.


Use

    Jump to {JumpToPageDropdown}

in the paginator template string.


The control will have a class

    yui-pg-jtp-options

and an id:
    
		id_base + '-jtp'
		
Where id_base is the, well, base id of the paginator.
